Car Pricing with Linear Regression

The given requirements of the project were to take an econometric / statistical analysis, translate it to a different language and improve the study. 
Based on the instructions, we choose Car Pricing with Linear Regression topic from Kaggle written in R code and translated it to Python and reproduced the results. 

To predict car pricing, a linear regression model along with traditional and machine learning modelling was used. The main basis of the process was to predict and analyse how the price of cars responds based on the changes in their features. 

The results of our study demonstrated the effectiveness of the linear regression model in predicting carsâ€™ prices.

As we stated above we used linear regression as it is one of the most common types of statistical analysis which is used to predict the relationship between two variables.
