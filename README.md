Car Pricing with Linear Regression


General Information

Linear regression is one of the most common types of statistical analysis which is used to predict the relationship between two variables. It assumes a linear relationship between the independent variables and dependent variables and aims to find the best-fitting line that describes the relationship. In order to find the line, the sum of the squared differences between the predicted values and actual values is minimised.
Linear regression can also be extended to multiple linear regression, where there are multiple independent variables, and logistic regression, which is used for binary classification problems.
