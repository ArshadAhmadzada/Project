Car Pricing with Linear Regression

General Information

Linear regression is one of the most common types of statistical analysis which is used to predict the relationship between two variables. It assumes a linear relationship between the independent variables and dependent variables and aims to find the best-fitting line that describes the relationship. The equation form of the line in the linear regression is Y = a + bX, where X is the explanatory variable and Y is the dependent variable. The slope of the line is b, and a is the intercept (the value of y when x = 0).
Linear regression can also be extended to multiple linear regression, where there are multiple independent variables and logistic regression.

The model includes a dependent variable y and one or more independent variables x. Multi linear regression is a technique to understand the relationship between a single dependent variable and multiple independent variables. Multi linear regression function can be found below.
yi = β0 + β1Xi1 + β2Xi2 +⋯+ βpXip +εi, i=1,⋯,n,
where,
•	n is the number of observations,
•	yi is the ith response,
•	β0 is the constant term of the model,
•	βk is the kth coefficient,
•	Xij is the ith observation on the jth predictor variable, j = 1, ..., p,
•	εi is the ith random error.
